Your pet has rolled around in mud
Your pet has eaten something foul and thrown up on themselves
You've recently taken your pet to the vet and they haven't eaten in a while
You've been gone a while! Your pet is bored!
A wild animal stole your pet's food! Now they have nothing to eat!
Your pet is so bored that they got tired of sleeping!
